### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Anna. I'm launching my new career in Tech with help of _nology. After moving to the UK I started learning coding on my own by using various free online resources including Microsoft, Codecademy, Code First Girls, Moo ICT, Khan Academy, and GitHub. 
Recently I have completed 12 week Full-Stack Development bootcamp at _nology.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on full-stack project Task Manager
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Spring Boot
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on project that use React, Javascript or Spring Boot and Java
